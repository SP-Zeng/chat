The starter code has XSS vulnerabilitiy, because the user is asked to enter a username (uame) in the index page, and that user input is sent to 
the server and the server echos back for it (uname) to be displayed in the chatroom page using innerHTML function at script.js. However, as we can see here that the 
username input is not checked and made safe for the broswer to render, and therefore, one malicious user can easily enter an exploited input.

In this case, I will use the image element. When being prompted to enter the username at the main page,
I will enter <img src="hhhhh" onerror=alert(document.cookie);> as my username and click join. After that, we go to the chatroom page, due to the .innerHTML method at script.js,
it will be asked to render an image in the supposedly username section and since the src of the image element doesn't exist, it will just alert with the human not understandable cookie,
and therefore the XSS is exploited.
